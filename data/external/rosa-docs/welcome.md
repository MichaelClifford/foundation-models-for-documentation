# Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS 4 Documentation

Welcome to the official Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) documentation, where you can learn about ROSA and start exploring its features. To learn about ROSA, interacting with ROSA using Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager and command-line interface (CLI) tools, consumption experience, and integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) services, start with [the Introduction to ROSA documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html-single/introduction_to_rosa/#rosa-understanding).
